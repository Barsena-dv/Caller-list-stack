# 📇 Profile Card Stack UI

An interactive **Profile Card & Call Note App** built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Users can add new profile cards through a form, and the cards stack visually like a deck.  
Each card stores data (image, name, hometown, purpose, category) in **LocalStorage**, so the cards persist across refreshes.
